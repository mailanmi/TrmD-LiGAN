# TrmD-LiGAN

Files used to design novel TrmD inhibitors with the LiGAN model [[1]](#1)

Folders:

* HiTrmD-PDB - protein and ligand structures used to train new model and generate potential TrmD inhibitors from H.influenzae and P.aeruginosa
* MTrmD-PDB protein and ligand structures used to train new model and generate potential TrmD inhibitors from M.smegmatis, M.abscessus, and M. tuberculosis
* Train-results - 
* generate-new - results obtained from newly trained models
* generate-oryg - results obtained from the original model
